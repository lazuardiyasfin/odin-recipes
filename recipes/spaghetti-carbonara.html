        <h2>Ingredients</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>1 pound spaghetti</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided, or as needed</li>
            <li>8 slices bacon, diced</li>
            <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
            <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
            <li>&frac14; cup dry white wine</li>
            <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
            <li>&frac12; cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
            <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps</h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Start by boiling a big pot of water with a pinch of salt. Once it's bubbling, add the spaghetti and give it a stir now and then. 
                Cook it for around 12 minutes until it's tender but still has a bit of a bite. Drain the pasta, mix in a tablespoon of olive oil, and put it aside.</li>
            <li>Cook diced bacon in a big skillet on medium heat, stirring it around until it's nice and brown, which should take about 10 minutes. 
                Once it's done, drain the bacon on paper towels, but make sure to keep 2 tablespoons of the bacon fat in the skillet.</li>
            <li>Mix in a tablespoon of olive oil with the bacon fat in the skillet. Toss in the chopped onion and saut√© over medium heat until it turns translucent. 
                Then, add the minced garlic and cook it for about a minute until it smells amazing. Pour in the wine and let it cook for another minute.</li>
            <li>Put the cooked bacon back in the skillet and throw in the cooked spaghetti. Mix it all up and heat it through, adding a splash of olive oil if it looks dry or starts to stick. 
                Then, pour in the beaten eggs and keep tossing with tongs or a big fork until the eggs are just about set. Quickly stir in 1/2 cup of Parmesan cheese and mix it up again. 
                Don't forget to season with salt and pepper, but keep in mind that both the bacon and Parmesan are pretty salty already.</li>
            <li>Enjoy it warm, topped with some chopped parsley and have extra Parmesan cheese available at the table.</li>
        </ol>
